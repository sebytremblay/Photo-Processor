##  Design Overview:

- We have an image processor which acts as our model. It performs all the functionality on the images, as well as stores them. Each "image" is represented as an array of pixels and a max value.
- We have a pixel class to represent a single pixel. Our particular implementation is an RGB pixel that stores each of the three color components. This inherits the Pixel interface so we can use different types of pixels later on.
- We have the ImageProcessorControllerImp to handle user inputs. This takes in a user command and maps it to the corresponding Function object to perform the intended functionality.
- We have RunImageProcessor as our Main method to run the image processor.


## Image Citation:

20by5 Image was generated by using a random number generator to get values between 0-255. We thus own the image and authorize ourselves to use it. 

## Completed Parts

- Can load and save .ppm, .jpg, .jpeg, .png, and .bng files 
- Can load on file type, do work on it, and save as another file type
- Can blur and sharpen an image
- Can greyscale and sepia an image
- Can visualize red, green, blue components of an image
- Can visualize intensity, luma, and value of an image
- Can brighten and darken an image
- Can horizontally and vertically flip an image
- Can accept a script file as a command-line argument

## Design Changes

- Decided to store maxValue attribute in each pixel class
